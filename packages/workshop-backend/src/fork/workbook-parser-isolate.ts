// Workbook parsing in a dynamic worker of its own, rather than in the workspace Durable Object.
//
// The parser's guards -- inflated size, row and row-byte ceilings -- assume a file's markup bounds
// how many cells it holds. Formats that encode repetition break that: an ODS row can declare it
// repeats a million times, and a cell written without its address costs a few bytes of XML. Such
// a file clears every guard that can run before SheetJS materializes the grid, and then
// materializes more than an isolate holds. No constant closes that class without refusing
// legitimate dense workbooks, so the parse runs where running out costs nothing: a fresh isolate
// loaded through the LOADER binding for this one upload, with its own memory budget, no bindings,
// no network and a CPU limit. If the parse exhausts it, that isolate dies and the upload is
// refused; the workspace keeps its state and its other users.
//
// The rows come back a chunk per call through a cursor the parser hands out, so the caller can
// store each before asking for the next: no RPC message carries more than one chunk, and the
// workspace never holds a whole workbook's rows.
