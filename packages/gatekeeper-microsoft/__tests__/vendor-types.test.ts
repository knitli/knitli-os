// The vendor serves every resource type's `.d.ts` as one string, joined with a newline
// (`GatekeeperVendor.getTypeScriptTypes`). Concatenating independently written declaration files is
// only safe if they were written not to collide, and nothing in the type system enforces that:
// `tsc` checks each file on its own, and the joined text is only ever assembled at runtime, where a
// duplicate identifier would surface as a parse failure in the Workshop's type database rather than
// at compile time. This parses what the vendor actually serves.
//
// The files are read from disk rather than imported: under vitest a `.txt` import resolves to a
// module reference, not the file's contents. `types.txt`, `teams-types.txt` and
// `sharepoint-types.txt`, which the vendor imports, are symlinks to the `.d.ts` files read here, so
// this is the same text — but the join is reproduced here rather than called, so it has to be kept
// in step with the vendor's.
