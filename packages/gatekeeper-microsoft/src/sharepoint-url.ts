// Parsing of the SharePoint list URL a user pastes to introduce a list.
//
// This is the only place a browser URL becomes the ids the Graph client works with, so it is strict
// on purpose: the host must really be SharePoint Online, and every path component it hands on must
// survive being split on `/` and re-encoded without changing what it addresses. Everything a page
// URL carries beyond that — the view page, the query string, the fragment — is view state, not
// identity, so it is ignored.
//
// SharePoint's "Copy link" button writes a different shape, `/:l:/r/sites/HR/Lists/Requests`: a
// one-letter type (`l` list, `f` folder, `w` doc …), a mode, then the path. Mode `r` is the only
// one that carries that real path, so it is stripped and parsing continues; the other modes carry
// an opaque share id instead and are refused.
//
// The parser never echoes the URL back in an error. The value came from a user and travels on to a
// toast and to an agent; saying what shape was expected is what helps, and it cannot carry anything
// hostile along with it.
