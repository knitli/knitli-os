// Shared fetch helper for the Microsoft Graph API client.
//
// Three retry/failure concerns compose here:
//
//   1. Auth (401). The access token we send can be stale or invalidated before its recorded expiry
//      — e.g. after a re-consent, an explicit revoke-then-reconnect, or the refresh-token rotation
//      Entra performs on every mint. The token is cached in the gatekeeper Durable Object's memory
//      and in the account's storage, so a stale-but-unexpired token would otherwise be served on
//      every request and the 401 could not self-heal. On a 401 we mint a fresh token via
//      `getAccessToken({ forceRefresh: true })` and retry exactly once. This is safe on any HTTP
//      method: a 401 is rejected before the request takes effect, so a write is never applied twice.
//      A 403 is an insufficient-permission error that a fresh token cannot fix, so it is never
//      retried.
//
//   2. Claims challenges (401 + `WWW-Authenticate: ... claims=...`). Conditional Access and
//      continuous access evaluation reject a token whose claims no longer satisfy tenant policy.
//      Minting again cannot help: the refresh token produces another token with the same claims, so
//      a retry would burn a token exchange and fail identically. Worse, the account looks alive —
//      refreshes succeed while every Graph call fails — so the UI never offers a reconnect. These
//      are therefore reported to the account authority as credential death (which is what surfaces
//      the reconnect prompt) and returned to the caller unretried.
//
//   3. Transient failures (429 / 5xx / network timeout). Retried with exponential backoff plus full
//      jitter, honoring `Retry-After` when present. A 5xx and a network timeout leave it ambiguous
//      whether the server already applied a write, so those replay idempotent GETs only. A 429 is
//      different: Graph rejects a throttled request before processing it, so replaying it — for any
//      method with a replayable body — cannot duplicate a write.
//
// All concerns share a single attempt counter, so the worst case is a predictable `retries + 1`
// requests: `retries` transient attempts plus at most one extra for the one-shot 401 refresh.
