/**
 * Wraps an `alarm()` body so it cannot loop:
 *
 * 1. With `disabled` (the `ALARMS_DISABLED` kill switch) it deletes the alarm, logs
 *    `alarm.disabled`, and returns without running `run`.
 * 2. It counts runs per clock hour. Past `maxPerHour` the circuit opens: it logs
 *    `alarm.circuit.open` once per hour at error level, skips `run`, and does not re-arm
 *    (or, with `deferWhenOpen`, re-arms for the next hour). The next hour closes it.
 * 3. If `run` throws, the guard owns the next alarm. It overrides whatever `run` armed with
 *    `now + backoff`, logs `alarm.failed`, and returns normally so the platform does not
 *    retry as well. A success resets the failure count.
 * 4. After `maxConsecutiveFailures` consecutive failures it deletes the alarm instead
 *    (`alarm.gave_up`). Only an outside re-arm, such as an RPC, runs it again, and the first
 *    success resets it.
 *
 * Cost: one KV read and at most one KV write per run. The counters live in one key
 * (`alarm-guard:<key>`), which is written only while the alarm is failing or has used more than
 * half its hourly budget, and is removed once neither holds. A healthy alarm therefore writes
 * nothing, and the guard stays invisible to code that lists or clears the object's own storage.
 * Counters are updated after `run`, so a run the runtime kills outright (CPU limit, eviction) is
 * not counted; the platform's own bounded retry covers that case.
