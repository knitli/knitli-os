// Microsoft Graph mail client.
//
// Every mailbox request in this package goes through `GraphMailApi.#request()`. That single
// chokepoint is what guarantees the two properties the rest of the code depends on:
//
//   - `Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId"` on EVERY request. Outlook's default message ids change when a
//     message moves between folders, and this gatekeeper captures ids when an action is queued and
//     uses them again when the action is approved — possibly minutes later, after a user drag, an
//     inbox rule, or an earlier approved move has relocated the message. Immutable ids are the only
//     ids that still resolve then.
//   - Bearer injection and the 401 / claims-challenge / throttling policy, via `fetchWithAuthRetry`.
//
// URL construction is likewise centralized: ids and search terms reach this file from an agent, so
// path segments are percent-encoded and every query parameter goes through `URLSearchParams`.
// Interpolating either raw would let a crafted id escape into the path or into OData syntax.
