// The addressed-row encoding: how spreadsheet rows are written out for the model to read.
//
// Every non-empty row becomes one line that starts with its Excel row number, followed by one
// `COLUMN=value` pair per non-empty cell -- `12 C="LNST Dự án" E=2970249.8`. Each value carries its
// own address, so the model never counts delimiters to find which column a value sits in, and a
// blank row costs nothing because the row numbers already say where everything is.
//
// Long runs of adjacent numbers -- a 34-quarter projection, a monthly series -- are the part of a
// sheet nobody reads cell by cell, and the part a model most often miscounts when it tries. With
// `collapse` on, such a run becomes `O..AV=34 nums (14215554 … 0)`: named, sized and located, but
// not enumerated. Text never collapses, so every label, header and note survives.
//
// Pure and deterministic: the same rows always render to the same bytes, because this text is
// replayed into every turn and a drifting prompt would invalidate cached context.
