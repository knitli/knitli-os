// Spreadsheet attachments, parsed into stored rows and a summary instead of serialized into the
// prompt.
//
// Every other document type reaches the model as Markdown replayed in full on every turn. A
// workbook cannot work that way: a 490 KB / 69k-cell file becomes 1.3 MB of padded Markdown, over
// 300k tokens, more than a 200k-token window holds -- and the padding still loses the things that
// matter (dates arrive as serial numbers, side-by-side tables are squashed into one).
//
// So this module splits the workbook in two. The rows go to storage as JSON chunks the agent
// reads through a binding, and only a budgeted deterministic *summary* goes into the prompt: every
// sheet's name and dimensions, and its cells as addressed rows (see workbook-grid.ts) -- the whole
// sheet when it is small, an outline of its row bands when it is not, and just the heading once the
// workbook's budget is spent. The summary is what the model sees every turn, so it is budgeted;
// the chunks are what it computes over.
//
// This module holds the shapes, the limits and the rendering; the parse itself lives in
// workbook-parse.ts, the one module that imports SheetJS, and runs in a dynamic worker of its own
// rather than in the workspace Durable Object (see workbook-parser-isolate.ts). Nothing here
// imports the parser, so the workspace can describe and store a workbook without loading it.
